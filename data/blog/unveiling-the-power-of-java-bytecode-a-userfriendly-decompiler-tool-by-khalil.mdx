Recently, I was working on a implementation where I needed to look at how the existing Java code was written. I used a tool called `JD-GUI` to decompile the .class files. When I was trying to save the decompiled class `JD-GUI` added extra comments that I didn't need. It was easy to delete these comments for small parts of the code, but for large java class or on batch selection, it became really hard. Additionally, I noticed that it's skipping the Java code, and there's no guarantee of achieving a 100% decompilation.

So, I decided to make my own tool that decompiles `.class` to `.java` form without unnecessary comments.

### Overview

I have designed this tool to simplify the process of decompiling Java classes. This tool provides a user-friendly graphical interface for easy navigation and utilization.

The decompiler is created using Java Swings, and it performs decompilation using procyon-compilertools.

Here is the `procyon-compilertools` mvn dependency.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.bitbucket.mstrobel</groupId>
    <artifactId>procyon-compilertools</artifactId>
    <version>0.6.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Features

**User-Friendly Interface:** The GUI (Graphical User Interface) facilitates effortless interaction.

**Input & Output Directory Selection:** Choose input and output directories for seamless decompilation.

**Progress Tracking:** A progress bar keeps track of the decompilation process.

**Error Handling:** Informative dialogs for invalid directories and errors ensure a smooth experience.

**Decompilation Results:** Generates .java files from .class files for analysis and understanding.

### Getting Started

The tool offers a simple setup:

**Input Directory:** Select the directory containing the .class files.

**Output Directory:** Choose where the decompiled .java files will be stored.

**Run:** Initiate the decompilation process.

### Code Structure

The tool consists of three primary components:

**Decompiler App**
The entry point of the application, invoking the GUI.

**Decompiler GUI**
The graphical interface, providing options to select input and output directories, initiate the decompilation process, and visualize the progress.

**Decompiler Core**
Responsible for the actual decompilation process, iterating through directories, identifying .class files, and converting them to readable .java files.

### Usage

1. Launch the application.
1. Select the input directory containing .class files.
1. Choose the output directory for the decompiled .java files.
1. Click the "Run" button to start the decompilation process.

**_Note_**
Ensure valid input and output directories.
Subdirectories within the input directory are also processed recursively.

### Conclusion

Java Decompiler is a valuable tool for developers seeking to understand Java bytecode effortlessly. Its intuitive interface and robust functionality make it an asset in exploring and comprehending Java applications.
