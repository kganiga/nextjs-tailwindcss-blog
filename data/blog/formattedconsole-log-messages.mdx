Have you ever opened developer tools on FB page? Did you see some warning messages in the Browser console that is formatted using custom styles and wondered? how it's done?

This made me curious to look at how is such formatting done.

You may already know that console messages are printed using console.log() method.
An interesting part of FB console message is it is styled and also hyperlink of Facebook's self xss.

After some research, I came to know that console API supports such functions.

### How to Apply CSS Styles to message in console:

To apply styles for the text in the console, we use the format specifier `%c`.

```js
console.log(
  '%cHello World',
  'font-variant: small-caps;color:blue; font-size:30px;font-weight:Bold;'
)
```

All the text after `%c` will be formatted with the format arguments. You can your own CSS styles to format your text.
