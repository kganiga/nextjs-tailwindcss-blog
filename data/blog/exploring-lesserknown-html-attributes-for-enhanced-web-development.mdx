![less known html attributes](/static/posts/images/html-attr.jpg)

HTML is super important for websites and can do a lot of different things. You might know about stuff like `class` and `id,` but there are other special things in HTML that can make your web pages even better. Let's check out some of these cool hidden features in this blog post!

Here's a comprehensive list of all the lesser-known HTML attributes:

## contenteditable

The `contenteditable` attribute is a game-changer when it comes to creating interactive web applications. Applied to elements like `<div>`, it allows users to edit the content directly in the browser.

```html
<div contenteditable="true">   This content can be edited.</div>
```

## spellcheck

Enhance user experience by controlling spell checking in input elements. The `spellcheck` attribute can be set to `false` to disable spell checking.

```html
<input type="text" spellcheck="false" />
```

## hidden

Keep your HTML clean by hiding elements until they are needed. The `hidden` attribute does just that.

```html
<p hidden>This paragraph is hidden.</p>
```

## download

Want to offer downloadable content with a simple link? Use the `download` attribute in `<a>` tags.

```html
<a href="file.zip" download>Download ZIP</a>
```

## draggable

Enable drag-and-drop functionality by utilizing the `draggable` attribute. Combine it with JavaScript for a powerful user experience.

```html
<div draggable="true">Drag me!</div>
```

## sandbox

Securely embed content in iframes with the `sandbox` attribute. It allows you to control the permissions of the embedded content.

```html
<iframe src="example.com" sandbox="allow-scripts"></iframe>
```

## async and defer

Fine-tune script execution with the `async` and `defer` attributes in `<script>` tags. They control when scripts are loaded and executed.

```html
<script async src="script.js"></script>
<script defer src="script.js"></script>
```

## scoped

Limit the scope of your styles to specific elements using the `scoped` attribute in `<style>` tags.

```html
<div>
     <style scoped>
          p { color: blue; }       
  </style>

     
  <p>This paragraph is blue.</p>
</div>
```

## ismap

The `ismap` attribute is used in the `<img>` tag to indicate that the image is part of a server-side image map. This attribute is crucial when you want to create interactive image maps with clickable regions.

```html
<img src="image.jpg" ismap />
```

## autocapitalize

Fine-tune the capitalization behavior of text input fields using the `autocapitalize` attribute. This is especially useful in form controls.

```html
<input type="text" autocapitalize="words" />
```

## nomodule

In the world of modern JavaScript, the `nomodule` attribute in `<script>` tags prevents the script from executing in browsers that support ES6 modules. This is handy when you have a fallback script for older browsers.

```html
<script nomodule src="fallback.js"></script>
```

## form

Associate an input element with a specific form, even if it's not directly nested within it, using the `form` attribute.

```html
<input type="text" name="username" form="loginForm" />
```

## sizes

Fine-tune the display of your favicon on different devices using the `sizes` attribute in the `<link>` tag.

```html
<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico" sizes="16x16 32x32" />
```

## open (in `<details>`)

The `open` attribute in the `<details>` tag specifies that the details content should be visible (open) by default.

```html
<details open>
   
  <summary>More Details</summary>
   
  <p>Hidden content is visible by default.</p>
</details>
```

## dropzone

The `dropzone` attribute in form elements defines an area where files can be dropped for upload.

```html
<input type="file" dropzone="copy" />
```

## crossorigin

The `crossorigin` attribute is used in `<script>`, `<img>`, and `<link>` tags to control how the browser handles cross-origin requests for the associated resource.

```html
<script src="script.js" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

## itemtype, itemscope, and itemprop

These attributes are part of the Microdata specification and are used to provide machine-readable information about the content on a page.

```html
<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">  <span itemprop="name">John Doe</span></div>
```

## high and low (in `<meter>`)

The `high` and `low` attributes in the `<meter>` element define the upper and lower bounds of the range represented by the meter.

```html
<meter value="60" min="0" max="100" low="30" high="70">60%</meter>
```

## language (in `<script>`)

The `language` attribute is used in the `<script>` tag to specify the scripting language of the embedded code.

```html
<script language="JavaScript">
  // JavaScript code here
</script>
```

## content (in `<meta>`)

The `content` attribute in the `<meta>` tag is used to provide metadata information, such as character set or viewport settings.

```html
<meta charset="UTF-8" />
```

## controls (in `<picture>`)

The `controls` attribute in the `<picture>` element is used to specify whether the user should be able to control the playback of the media.

```html
<picture controls>
   
  <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp" />

    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" />
</picture>
```

## dirname (in `<input>` with type="text" or type="search")

The `dirname` attribute is used to specify the directionality of the text in an input field.

```html
<input
  type="text

"
  dirname="rtl"
/>
```

## oncontextmenu

The `oncontextmenu` attribute is used to specify a JavaScript function that will be executed when the right mouse button is clicked on an element.

```html
<div oncontextmenu="showContextMenu(event)">Right-click me</div>
```

## translate (in `<html>` or `<body>`)

The `translate` attribute is used in the `<html>` or `<body>` tag to specify whether the content of the page should be translated.

```html
<html translate="no"></html>
```

## pattern (in `<input>` with type="text" or type="password")

The `pattern` attribute is used to specify a regular expression that the input's value must match.

```html
<input type="text" pattern="[A-Za-z]{3}" />
```

## reversed (in `<ol>`)

The `reversed` attribute is used in the `<ol>` tag to indicate that the order of the list items should be reversed.

```html
<ol reversed>
   
  <li>Third item</li>
   
  <li>Second item</li>
   
  <li>First item</li>
</ol>
```

These attributes provide a wealth of options for developers to enhance their web pages. As always, consider the specific requirements of your project and ensure browser compatibility for a seamless user experience. Stay tuned for more insights into the world of web development!
