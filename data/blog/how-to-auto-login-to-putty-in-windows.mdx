In this gudie I will show you how to create a Windows shortcut , which will store PuTTY session information so that you don't have to enter the username and password every time you login.

If you haven't installed PuTTY, you can download it from from [putty.org](https://putty.org)

### Create a Windows shortcut

Begin by creating a Windows shortcut

- Right click on the Desktop and select News and Shortcut.

- Select putty.exe, click OK and Next.Enter a name for you shortcut.
  e.g. LinuxServer and click Finish.
- Right-click on your new shortcut and click Properties.
  Take note of the Target field. It shows the path to putty.exe in Program Files.

- After the double quotes, paste in the following
  `user@server.com -pw password` \
  Replace user with username, server.com with your server address and password with your server password.

Click OK and you’re done!

Now when you double-click the shortcut it will bring you straight into your Linux server without having to enter username or password.
