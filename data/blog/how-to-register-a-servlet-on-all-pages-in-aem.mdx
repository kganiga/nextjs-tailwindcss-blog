Recently I came across a usecase, where a servlet is getting invoked on all pages(including OOTB pages) of our AEM instances. I checked the source code for the implementation to see how its developed.

**Solution:** 
The servlet was registered with resourceType:  **cq/Page** so that Servlet is registered for every Page.

With the use of a particular selector we can get results like list information/required custom information for every AEM page and display either via component with its ajax request has a url of Current Page. Selector which invokes the Servlet and renders result .

**Note**: â€“ Just for reference Sling resolves on basis of Primary Type example `cq:Page` for Page and `dam:Asset` for Dam in case `sling:resourceType` is missing .

**Code Snippet**
```java

    import java.io.IOException;
    import javax.servlet.Servlet;
    import javax.servlet.ServletException;
    import org.apache.sling.api.SlingHttpServletRequest;
    import org.apache.sling.api.SlingHttpServletResponse;
    import org.apache.sling.api.servlets.SlingSafeMethodsServlet;
    import org.osgi.service.component.annotations.Component;
    
    @Component(service = Servlet.class, property = { "sling.servlet.resourceTypes=" + "cq/Page",
    		"sling.servlet.extensions=" + "json", "sling.servlet.selectors=" + "result", "service.ranking=" + "50000" })
    public class SampleServlet extends SlingSafeMethodsServlet {
    
    	/**
    	 * 
    	 */
    	private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;
    
    	@Override
    	protected void doGet(SlingHttpServletRequest request, SlingHttpServletResponse response)
    			throws ServletException, IOException {
    		//Implement your logic
    	}
    
    }

```
