Following is the list of SQL2 and Xpath queries which are widely used in day to day aem development.

## SQL2

### All nodes with a specific name

```
SELECT * FROM [nt:unstructured] AS nodeWHERE ISDESCENDANTNODE(node, "/search/in/path")
AND NAME() = "nodeName"

```

### All pages below content path

```
SELECT * FROM [cq:Page] AS page
WHERE ISDESCENDANTNODE(page ,"/search/in/path")
```

### All components of a specific Resource Type

```
SELECT * FROM [nt:unstructured] AS comp
WHERE ISDESCENDANTNODE(comp, "/search/in/path")
AND [sling:resourceType] = "componentType"
```

### All nodes where a property contains some String

```
SELECT * FROM [nt:unstructured] AS node
WHERE ISDESCENDANTNODE(node, "/search/in/path")
AND CONTAINS([propertyName], "someString")
```

### All nodes where a property is not null and not empty

```
SELECT * FROM [nt:unstructured] AS node
WHERE node.[propertyName] IS NOT NULL AND node.[propertyName] <> ""
```

### All nodes where a property is null or empty

```
SELECT * FROM [nt:unstructured] AS node
WHERE (node.[propertyName] = "" OR node.[propertyName] IS NULL)
```

### All nodes where a property is of type Date (also possible: String, Long, Boolean and more)

```
SELECT * FROM [nt:unstructured] AS node
WHERE ISDESCENDANTNODE(node, "/search/in/path")
AND PROPERTY(node.[propertyName], "DATE") LIKE "%"
```

### Date property of child node is greater than

```
SELECT page.* FROM [cq:Page] AS page
INNER JOIN [cq:PageContent] AS jcrcontent ON ISCHILDNODE(jcrcontent, page)
WHERE ISDESCENDANTNODE(page, "/content/path/to/page")
AND jcrcontent.[cq:lastModified] >= CAST("2019-01-01T00:00:00.000Z" AS DATE)
```

###Every page with specific name

```
SELECT * FROM [cq:Page] AS page
WHERE ISDESCENDANTNODE(page, "/search/in/path")
AND name() = "pageName"
```

### Every page with specific name, that has a child node with a specific name

```
SELECT * FROM [cq:Page] AS page
INNER JOIN [nt:base] AS childnode ON ISCHILDNODE(childnode, page)
WHERE ISDESCENDANTNODE(page, "/search/in/path")
AND name(page) = "pageName"
AND name(childnode) = "nodeName"
```

## XPATH

### Property not empty

```
/jcr:root/content/path/to/page//nodeName[@propertyName != ""]
```

### Specific property contains

```
/jcr:root/content/path/to/page//nodeName[jcr:contains(@propertyName,'someValue')]
```

### Any property contains

```
/jcr:root/content/path/to/page//*[jcr:contains(., 'someValue')]
```

### AND operation (for more than one property)

```
/jcr:root/content/path/to/page//*[@firstPropertyName = "someValue",@secondPropertyName != "anotherValue"]
```

### Get all jcr:content nodes that

have a specific resourceType \
have any property that contains a specific (text-) value \
have a "grandchild" node, which has a specific resourceType \
have a "grandchild" node, which has a property called "date" greater than "2012-06-01" and less than "2016-07-01" and order the result by the date property in descending order.

```
/jcr:root/content/path/to/node//element(*,cq:PageContent)[@sling:resourceType="someType"and jcr:contains(., "someValue") and */*/@sling:resourceType="anotherType" and */*/@date >= xs:dateTime("2012-06-01T00:00:00.000+02:00") and */*/@date <= xs:dateTime("2016-07-01T00:00:00.000+02:00")] order by pathto/grandchild/@date descending
```
