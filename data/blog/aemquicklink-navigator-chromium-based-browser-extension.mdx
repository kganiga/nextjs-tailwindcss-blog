AEM development is indeed tough job. Navigating to different consoles wastes a lot of time. Although making a bookmark for every console saves time, but bookmarking is not an option when there are multiple environments.

I've developed a chromium-based web browser plugin that makes it simple and much quicker to switch between various AEM consoles of each environment.

It is developed as per touch UI.

On first install, it will display default author and publish environments running on ports 4502 and 4503.

The core feature of the extension is it will allow to add multiple environments.
