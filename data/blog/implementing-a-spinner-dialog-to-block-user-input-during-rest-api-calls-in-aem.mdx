In web development, ensuring a seamless user experience during asynchronous operations is crucial. Recently, I came across a use case where I needed display a spinner dialog and block user input while a REST call was in progress in AEM. This post walks you through how I achieved this by leveraging Coral UI components.

[Coral UI Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-manager/reference-materials/6-5/coral-ui/coralui3/components.html)

## The Challenge

When a REST call is initiated, it's important to prevent users from interacting with the application until the operation is complete. Initially, I used the `Coral Wait` API to display a waiting dialog during the AJAX call. While this did show a loader, it did not completely prevent user interactions in the background. Users were still able to click on elements, which could potentially disrupt the REST operation and lead to inconsistent states.

## Initial Approach: Using Coral Wait API

Coral Wait is used as to indicate a process that is in-progress for an indefinite amount of time. Hereâ€™s how I implemented it initially:

```JavaScript
(function(document, $) {
    var wait;
    var wait = new Coral.Wait().set({
        size: "L",
        centered: true
    });
    wait.id = "restCallInProgressWaitId";
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
        document.body.appendChild(wait);
    });

    $(document).on('click', '#yourButton', function() {
        wait.open();
        // Make the AJAX call
        $.ajax({
            url: 'your/rest/endpoint',
            method: 'GET',
            success: function(response) {
                // Handle the response
            },
            complete: function() {
                wait.close();
            }
        });

    });
})
```

While this effectively displayed a loader, it didn't block user interactions in the background. This limitation meant that users could still click on other buttons or links while the loader was visible.

## Enhanced Solution: Combining Coral Wait and Coral Dialog

To fully block user input, I needed a more robust solution. I discovered that by injecting the Coral Wait component inside a Coral Dialog. The reason behind using coral dialog is it fires the coral-overlay events in the background which prevents any background interactions.

Here's how I implemented the enhanced solution

```JavaScript
(function(document, $) {
    var dialog;
    var dialog = new Coral.Dialog().set({
        id: "restCallInProgressDialogId",
        backdrop: 'static',
        variant: 'default',
        closable: 'off',
        open: false
    });

    var wait = new Coral.Wait().set({
        size: "L",
        centered: true
    });
    wait.id = "restCallInProgressWaitId";

    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
        dialog.content.appendChild(wait);
        document.body.appendChild(dialog);
    });

    $(document).on('click', '#yourButton', function() {
        if (dialog) {
            dialog.open = true;
        }
        // Make the AJAX call
        $.ajax({
            url: 'your/rest/endpoint',
            method: 'GET',
            success: function(response) {
                // Handle the response
            },
            complete: function() {
                dialog.open = false;
            }
        });

    });
})
```

```css
#restCallInProgressDialogId .coral2-Dialog-wrapper {
  background-color: inherit;
}
```

## Benefits of the Enhanced Solution

By using the Coral Dialog to encapsulate the Coral Wait component, I achieved the desired functionality:

- Full User Input Blocking: The Coral Dialog's overlay prevents any user interactions with the background elements.
- Customizable Loading Indicator: The Coral Wait component provides a clean and professional loading indicator within the dialog.

## Conclusion

Blocking user input during REST operations is essential for maintaining the integrity of the application state. By combining Coral Wait with Coral Dialog, I was able to create a user-friendly solution that not only displays a loading indicator but also prevents any user actions until the REST call is complete. This approach ensures a smoother and more reliable user experience in AEM.

Feel free to implement this in your AEM projects and let me know if you have any questions or improvements!
