Broken images are ugly..

![This is Broken Image! Ugly isn't it?](http://khalilganiga.netlify.app/broken.jpg)

I will explain a couple of methods to fix broken images.

- Hide the broken image dynamically using jQuery
- Use CSS to style the broken image.

### Using jQuery :

Hide the broken image, by adding the following attribute

```JavaScript
<img src="Error.src" onerror="this.style.display='none'"/>
```

Replace the broken image with fall back image.

```JavaScript
<img src="Error.src" onerror ="this.src='fallback-img.jpg'"/>
```

### Using CSS:

To understand how we can style broken images, there are two facts about the way the `<img>` element behaves that we need to understand first.

We can apply regular typography-related styling to the `<img>` element. These styles will be applied to the alternative text, if it is displayed, and will not affect the working image.
The `<img>` element is a replaced element. This is an element “whose appearance and dimensions are defined by an external resource” (Sitepoint). Because the element is controlled by an external source, the `:before` and `:after` pseudo-elements typically shouldn’t work with it. However, when the image is broken and not loaded, these pseudo-elements can appear.

Because of these two facts, we are able to apply styles to the `<img>` element that will only appear when the image is broken, and will leave a working image unaffected.

### Time for practice:

One way we can handle broken images is to provide a message to the user saying that the image is broken. Using the attr() expression, we can even display the link to the broken image.

```CSS
img {
  font-family: 'Helvetica';
  font-weight: 300;
  line-height: 2;
  text-align: center;

  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  display: block;
  position: relative;
}

img:before {
  content: "We're sorry, the image below is broken :(";
  display: block;
  margin-bottom: 10px;
}

img:after {
  content: "(url: " attr(src) ")";
  display: block;
  font-size: 12px;
}
```

In addition to (or instead of) displaying a custom message, we can use the pseudo-elements to apply more styling to the broken image.

```CSS
img {
  /* Same as first example */
  min-height: 50px;
}

img:before {
  content: " ";
  display: block;

  position: absolute;
  top: -10px;
  left: 0;
  height: calc(100% + 10px);
  width: 100%;
  background-color: rgb(230, 230, 230);
  border: 2px dotted rgb(200, 200, 200);
  border-radius: 5px;
}

img:after {
  content: "\f127" " Broken Image of " attr(alt);
  display: block;
  font-size: 16px;
  font-style: normal;
  font-family: FontAwesome;
  color: rgb(100, 100, 100);

  position: absolute;
  top: 5px;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  text-align: center;
}
```

If the image is not broken, with all the same styles applied to the element, the image is displayed normally. The pseudo-elements are not generated at all.
