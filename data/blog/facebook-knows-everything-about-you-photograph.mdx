Have you ever inspected the image on Facebook? If not try today. Facebook can determine what objects and scenes present in your photographs, even when you may not have added any description.

Check out the below screenshot:

Sounds interesting right.

Facebook can accurately figure it out from the photo itself. They internally generate captions. The intention behind these machine-generated captions is to make photographs more accessible to blind users.

These tags are called #### Facebook computer vision tags.

Facebook’s computer vision tags cover multiple concepts including food, objects (e.g., eyeglasses), people’s expression (are they smiling?), sports, nature (sky, mountains), and more. The best part is it can accurately give the number of people in a group photo.

Cheers..!
