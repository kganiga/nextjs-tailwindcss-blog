Here are the 12 important Google URLs that every Google user should know about. So, lets know about these Google URLs and strong your vocabulary about Google.

1 [https://passwords.google.com](https://passwords.google.com)
Google stores a list of usernames and passwords that you have typed in Google Chrome or Android for logging into various websites. They even have a website too where you can view all these passwords in plain text.

2 [https://www.google.com/alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts)
Google Alerts is another service that I think very few people know about it. But I’ve listed this Google URL here because I found it very useful for every Google user. Actually, this service will help you to get email alerts of any company, product, or anything you desire. Just visit the URL above and search for anything you wanna receive an alert for.

3 [https://maps.google.com/locationhistory](https://maps.google.com/locationhistory)
As you know Google tracks your locations and shows them in many places such as Facebook and others. Do you want to know all the history of your locations tracked by Google till now? then, visit this Google URL for that.

4 [https://history.google.com](https://history.google.com) \
 &nbsp;&nbsp;[Voice searches](https://google.com/history/audio) \
 &nbsp;&nbsp; [YouTube searches and watched videos](https://youtube.com/feed/history)
Do you know Google records all your search queries that you enter and search on Google search? Yes, Google records and saves all your search queries and sites you visited through Google search. You can see the history of your Google searches by visiting the above URL.

5 [https://security.google.com/settings/security/activity](https://security.google.com/settings/security/activity)
Have you any doubt that somebody else is using your Google account without your permission? you can check it out by using the above mentioned Google URL. However, you can not remotely log out of your Google account like Facebook but yes you should change your password to secure your account from unfamiliar activities.

6 [https://www.google.com/takeout](https://www.google.com/takeout)
Do you know you can download all your archive on Google such as your photos, emails, bookmarks and many more through this important Google URL. As soon as you visit this URL, you’ll have to sign in to your Google account and then you can select products and download the archive in seconds.

7 [https://google.com/maps/timeline](https://google.com/maps/timeline)
Your Android phone or the Google Maps app on your iPhone is silently reporting your location and velocity (are you moving and if yes, how fast are you moving) back to Google servers. You can find the entire location history on the Google Maps website and you also have the option to export this data as KML files that can be viewed inside Google Earth or even Google Drive.

8 [https://google.com/settings/account/inactive](https://google.com/settings/account/inactive)
You need to login to your Gmail account at least once every 9 months else Google may terminate your account according to their program policies. This can be an issue if you have multiple Gmail accounts so as a workaround, you can set up your main Gmail account as the trusted contact for your secondary accounts. Thus Google will keep sending you reminders every few months to log into your other accounts.

9 [https://www.google.com/settings/security](https://www.google.com/settings/security)
This is another very important Google URL that every Google user should know about. In fact, here you can not only change your All in one Google account password but also add recovery email, recovery phone etc.

10 [http://google.com/android/](http://google.com/android/)
Can’t locate your mobile phone? You can use the Google Device Manager to find your phone provided it is switched on and connected to the Internet. You can ring the device, see the location or even erase the phone content remotely. You can even find the IMEI Number of the lost phone from your Google Account.

11 [https://accounts.google.com/SignUpWithoutGmail](https://accounts.google.com/SignUpWithoutGmail)
A new Google Account using your existing email address. The regular sign-up process uses your@gmail.com address as your Google account username but with this special URL, you can use any other email address as your username.

12 [https://support.google.com/legal](https://support.google.com/legal)
If you ever find your content appearing on another website, you can raise a DMCA complaint with Google against that site to get the content removed. Google has a simple wizard to help you claim content and the tool can also be used to remove websites from Google search results that are scraping your content.
