Real-time desktop or browser notifications for something like incoming emails or Slack messages make sense. New articles on a website you just heard of for the first time because it showed up in the search results? That makes less sense. That doesn't stop websites from asking you to let them send push notifications to your desktop or browser.

If you're tired of seeing these pop-ups and having to decline the requests, you can change your Chrome settings to either block all push notification requests or block them on specified sites.

To turn of Chrome notifications follow the below steps

- Open Chrome and Go to Settings
- Then type notifications in the top search bar (or)
- Click on Privacy and Security >Site Settings >Notifications
- Toggle the notifications to blocked

This will block all the chrome notifications for all the sites.
