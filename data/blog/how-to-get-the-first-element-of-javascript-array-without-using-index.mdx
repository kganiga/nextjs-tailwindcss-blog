A simple and fairly efficient solution to fetch first element of array in JavaScript is by using [] operator.

Run the below code in the browser console.

```JavaScript
var a = [1,2,3,4,5];

var [b] = a;

console.log(b);
```

How to get rest of the array elements: Just run the below snippet in browser console.

```JavaScript
var [c,...rest] = a;

console.log("remaining array elements "+rest);
```

Cheers..!
