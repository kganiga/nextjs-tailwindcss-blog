### Day CQ Mail Service Configuration:

1. Go to the Felix Console Config Manager(http://localhost:4502/system/console/configMgr)
2. Scroll down and click to edit the Day CQ Mail Service OSGi config.
3. Enter the following details

| SMTP Server Host  | smtp-relay.sendinblue.com     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| SMTP Server Port  | 587                           |
| SMTP User         | Login Email in Sendinblue     |
| SMTP Password     | Master Password in Sendinblue |
| From Address      | from address                  |
| SMTP Use SSL      | Don't Check                   |
| SMTP use StartTLS | Yes                           |

4. Hit Save

5. Run a user through a workflow containing a group of which you are a member, or send out a newsletter to a group which you are a part of.

You should receive the email in your inbox.

It is worth noting that for production environments, you should set up a production grade SMTP service rather than use GMail.
