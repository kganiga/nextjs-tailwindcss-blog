The right-click context menu in Windows 11 has been rebuilt to provide better experience, however there are less options available than in the previous menu.

It requires a extra click (`Show more options`) to see more options or use `Shift + F10` keyboard shortcut to access the other entries.

If you don't like the new Windows 11 menu design, it is possible to disable the new context menu to enable the new classic right-click menu by editing the Registry.

**Note** : I am using command line way to edit the registry

1. Open Windows Terminal with Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt. You donâ€™t need to start it as administrator, since the override will be set per-user basis.
2. Copy and paste the following command into Windows Terminal, then press Enter

   ```
   reg add "HKCU\Software\Classes\CLSID\{86ca1aa0-34aa-4e8b-a509-50c905bae2a2}\InprocServer32" /f /ve
   ```

   If everything goes right, it should say "The operation completed successfully."

3. Close Windows Terminal.
4. Restart the PC to make the override key take effect.
