> In Kadapa district, Every hill has a story, every river has song.
> -J. Wilkinson

Mukkonda is a hill place and has a `Sivalayam`(temple of Mallikarjunaswami) at the peak of the hill. It is located 7 km northeast to Mydukur. Every year in kaarthikamasam (one of the months in Telugu calendar) on the final Monday sourrounding villagers will celebrate tirunala (festival) on this hill.

The route leading to Mukkonda via Mydukuru is very beautiful and it passes via fields, Yallampalli cheruvu (lake) and over Telugu ganga canal.

The story of Mukkonda near Mydukuru is illustrative of Wilkinson's remark.

### Story of the hill:

Once upon a time, In KritYuga, during the period of three-fifths of rain per month, there used to live two brothers in the area where Mukkonda is now, who used to farm and grow crops.

Once, the crop of sorghum(the Indian millet) flourished wonderfully into highest constellations. One fine day, a Sanyasi(monk) from nearby ashram visits the two brothers for alms but the two brothers told him to leave and come by later.

By this action of brothers, the Sanyasi got angry and cursed their sorghum to turn into piles of mud and stones. Due to this curse, the constellations remained as hills.

They are called the `అన్నదమ్ముల రాశులు` (constellations of brothers).

This story registered in `Mackenzie's Kaifiyats` as `PeraniPaadu Kaifiyats`.

#### There is another story wandering around the hill.

There lived two brothers who were farmers and were very affectionate and amicable to each other.
The two brothers divided the land in half and each one farmed his own section.Over time, the older brother married and had six children, while the younger brother never married.

One night, the younger brother lay awake. "It's not fair that each of us has half the land to farm," he thought. "My brother has six children to feed and I have none. He should have more grain than I do."

That night the younger brother went to his barn and gathered a large bundle of wheat. He climbed the hill that separated the two farms and over to his brother's farm. Leaving the wheat in his brother's barn, the younger brother returned home, feeling pleased with himself.
Earlier that very same night, the older brother was also lying awake. "It's not fair that each of us has half the land to farm," he thought. "In my old age my wife and I will have our grown children to take care of us, not to mention grandchildren, while my brother will probably have none. He should at least sell more grain from the fields now so he can provide for himself with dignity in his old age."

So that night, too, he secretly gathered a large bundle of wheat and climbed the hill. He left the grain in his brother's barn and returned home, feeling pleased with himself.

The next morning, when the younger brother went into his barn he was surprised to see the amount of grain was unchanged. "I must not have taken as much wheat as I thought," he said, bemused. "Tonight I'll be sure to take more."
That very same moment, his older brother was also standing in his barn, musing much the same thoughts.

After night fell, each brother gathered a greater amount of wheat from his barn and in the dark, secretly delivered it to his brother's barn. The next morning, the brothers were again puzzled and perplexed.
"There's the same amount of grain here as there was before I cleared the pile for my brother. This is impossible! Tonight I'll make no mistake - I'll take the pile down to the very floor. That way I'll be sure the grain gets delivered to my brother."

The third night, more determined than ever, each brother gathered a large pile of wheat from his barn, loaded it onto a cart, and slowly pulled his haul through the fields and up the hill to his brother's barn. At the top of the hill, under the shadow of a moon, each brother noticed a figure in the distance. Who could it be?

When the two brothers recognized the form of the other brother and the load he was pulling behind, they realized what had happened.
Without a word, they dropped the ropes to their carts, and embraced.

Due to this profound connection between these two brothers , this hill place remained as `అన్నదమ్ముల రాశులు` resembling brother's love.
