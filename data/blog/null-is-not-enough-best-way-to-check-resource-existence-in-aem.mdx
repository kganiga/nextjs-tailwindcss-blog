Today I came to know an intersting fact about AEM's [resourceResolver](https://developer.adobe.com/experience-manager/reference-materials/6-5/javadoc/org/apache/sling/api/resource/ResourceResolver.html#getResource-java.lang.String-) api. As AEM developers We usually use the `resolver.getResource(assetPath)` method to get resources, and then do the null checks.

But here's the thing: sometimes, if the asset path is not correct or moved to another location, this method doesn't return null.

lets consider this scenario :
You're working on a component that needs an image resource. You might have written code like:

```java
Resource imageResource = resolver.getResource(imagePath);
if (null != imageResource) {
    // Do something with the imageResource
}

```

The method won't give us null. Instead, it'll give us something called a `NonExistingResource`, and our check for null won't catch it. This could lead to unexpected issues later on.

**How to fix this?**
It's simple: double-check the resource using existance `ResourceUtil` api.

```java
Resource imageResource = resolver.getResource(imagePath);
if (null != imageResource && !ResourceUtil.isNonExistingResource(imageResource)) {
    // The resource is good to use!
}
```

By adding this extra check, we can avoid those tricky bugs caused by invalid resources. This way, our components will work more reliably.

Cheers!
