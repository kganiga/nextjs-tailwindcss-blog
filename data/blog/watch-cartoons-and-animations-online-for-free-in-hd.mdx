Are you a fan of cartoons and animations? Are you looking for the greatest website to watch TV episodes for free and legally?

So you're in the right place.

If you were a millennial kid who lived through the golden era of Cartoon Network, then you were blessed to have witnessed some of the best content being produced in animation. Kids back in the 90s and the early 2000s didnâ€™t have the luxuries that every kid today enjoys.

Remember this was when cable television was still relevant and the Internet was only showing hints of what it would be capable of, eventually.

These cartoons were aired at a specific time on their designated network. So there was an unmatched air of excitement in the air as most of us waited with bated breath to catch our favorite cartoon shows.

Missing them was simply not an option. If you missed an episode of Justice League or Scooby-Doo, then you had to either wait for the re-run or make peace with the fact that you may never get to watch that episode ever again.

Recently I found a best website to watch all my favorite shows for free(legally) in HD.

[Watch Cartoon Online](https://www.wcofun.net/) is the biggest online archieve for cartoons.

The website has a huge selection of cartoons to choose from, and it's easy to find the cartoon you're looking for.

The website is also easy to use, and it's free to watch cartoons on it.

### How to download the episodes to watch offline

I thought of writing a web scraper to download these shows on my local computer to watch them offline. Fortunately, I discovered a Java tool that makes it possible to download videos and series from `https://www.wcofun.net/`.

The utility was built using java8 and kotlin.

You need java 8 to run this program. [https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)

You will need Chrome, Chromium, Opera, Edge, Firefox or Safari to use this program.

[Click here](https://github.com/NobilityDeviant/Wcofun.com_Downloader/releases/download/1.4.9/TWCD.zip) to download the utility.

Unzip the TWCD.zip

Double click on the `run.bat` file.
